Problem Statement: Critical Delays in Blood
Transfusions
Emergency blood donor searches are slow, causing critical delays. The current process often relies on manual
coordination, resulting in inefficiencies and increased risk for patients.



Stakeholders
• Primary: Blood donors, patients, hospitals

• Secondary: Blood banks, NGOs managing blood
  donation drives
Market Size: The Global Need for
Blood Donations                                                          Blood Donation Statistics


Global Need:
•118.5 million blood donations are made annually (Source: WHO).
•Many countries face critical shortages of voluntary donors.                       25%


India-Specific Data:
•Annual demand: 12 million units (Source: Indian Blood Services).                                 55%
•Annual supply: 9 million units, creating a deficit of 3 million units
                                                                                  20%
(Source: WHO).
•20% of blood is wasted due to inefficient management (Source: Red

Opportunity:
•Bridging the demand-supply gap could save thousands of lives
annually by ensuring timely and efficient blood donation processes.      Effective Supply   Wastage     Deficit

Donor and recipient profiles are input into the system. The AI matching algorithm scores based on blood
type, location, and last donation. Notifications are sent to suitable donors, and inventory is updated for
hospital use, engaging donors, hospitals, patients, and NGOs.
